Hi, Usually I use ffmpeg command in terminal to copy stream video from the HLS protocol. If I want to save streams from several urls, I use semicolon sign `;` at each ffmpeg command. As example: `root@ubuntu:~# ffmpeg -hide_banner -i "` ` ( -c:v copy -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc "video-01.mp4"; ffmpeg -hide_banner -i "` ` ( -c:v copy -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc. I was trying to upgrade the RAM on my PC and when i removed the old ram and installed the new ram, once i turned the PC back on nothing works. Nothing is being displayed on the screen, my keyboard is not lighting up. Anyone know what is wrong or what i possibly do wrong.

Hi Reddit! I'm not going to lie, I had ordered a PC from Cyberpower a few years ago and below are the current specs. I would like to learn more about PC building, and what's better than to get help from you all! I would like to begin a gaming stream, but I do not know where to begin. I would like my PC to also be able to handle a bigger workload for future engineering/architecture projects (Major Specific courses). A friend of mine recommended I get a new I9 processor, but I would I was thinking of upgrading my HTPC due to it being so slow lately that it won't even run simple games like jackbox. But my main PC could use an upgrade, too. I'm considering upgrading everything but the video card on my main PC, and moving the components to the HTPC, effectively upgrading both PCs. #My only question is: How capable would my current PC (minus video card) be as an HTPC? Current HTPC specs: CPU: AMD Athlon X2 240 Video: Radeon HD 4200 RAM: 4GB DDR3 MOBO: Gigabyte GA-MA785. I have bought EX4300 and ERX300 on ebay to study it and started to read documentation. After some time i wanted to test my knowledge and configure it to test it at home. I have managed to set up SRX300 as a router with ge-0/0/\ 0-3\ ports configured as untagged with different subnetworks in each of them, and SRX works as a clock without any problem. But when i wired SRX and EX, i found some unexpected behavior. amp#x200B; Configuration Description: SRX subnetwork. Questions - What should I try next? - Could a bad PSU cause this? - Could a bad hard drive cause this? - Are these signs of a bad motherboard? Any input is greatly appreciated Got home from work, turned on PC, logged in, went to Amazon and then it froze; black screen but high contrast colors showed through the black. It was mostly black though. Restarted, made it to login, black screen crash again with some visible background. I restarted like 5-10 times and it kept failing. 
Hi All! I'm looking to get a new monitor that costs no more than 0. I have 0 in gift cards for Best Buy so it has to be from them sadly. I mostly use my PC for gaming (specs below - as you can see, not too powerful but enough for most new games High quality at 1080p at steady 60fps ) with some light photo editing and web browsing. I am open to any ideas you may have. Thank you in advance!! amp#x200B; Current Monitor is Asus VS248H (24", 60 Hz refresh, 2ms response, 1080p) amp#x200B. Hi guys, I can't turn on my 2 yr old gaming pc. It's weird, it starts up, fans whirl, there's some thunk sound, but within 2 seconds everything stops and it repeats.
