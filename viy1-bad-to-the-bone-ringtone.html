                            <p> Ok so I fell asleep writing this so sorry for the bad grammar of typos. So last probably around idk four am I thought I heard knocking at the door and excitedly got up thinking my boyfriend (who by the way name is Sam) had left his house keys. However when I got to the door I heard Sams ring tone in the bedroom. Confused I looked at the door and then went back to the room and grabbed my phone. (His ringtone by the only exception by paramours, because shut up I’m sappy) I picked. Ok so I fell asleep writing this so sorry for the bad grammar of typos.

However when I got to the door I heard Sams ring tone in the bedroom. Confused I looked at the door and then went back to the room and grabbed my phone. (His ringtone by the only exception by paramours, because shut up I’m sappy) I picked. I’m sitting here in my room, absolutely terrified to look at my phone. I’m paranoid to the point where I’m afraid to even be online , for fear of getting an email or a Skype call or an instant message. I shut my WiFi off as soon as I got home but I know I’ll have to turn it on to post this. I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore or how to stop this, and I’m praying that someone out there sees this and can help me understand what’s happening. My heart is broken, my anxiety is level First (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/970uz6/hellbound_i_the_paladins/) Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ahpdkl/hellbound_xxiv_the_game/) --- ampnbsp; Admiral Stephen Dai – Dimensional Plane of Arenal – Yggdrasil – 1 Month since the Infernal invasion of Earth ampnbsp; ampnbsp; “My apologies for being late.” The devil said with a smirk that exposed his fanged teeth, sending an involuntary reaction through Stephen’s spine. “My name is Zariel 
12:35pm, Sunday. New York City. ampnbsp; The demon walked across the plaza seemingly unimpeded by the people that walked around it, not giving it any notice. Its body was 10 feet long and 5 feet high, with long legs that took up half it’s height. Its body was shaped like a salamander, its snout resembled more of a crocodile, and whatever passed for eye’s instead of dark purple orbs that was barely noticeable in it’s dark grey skin color. The demon stopped. Just to get this out of the way, I don’t want to try to convince you what I am doing is moral - or right - because I know I can't. The reason I am writing this is for later. Ok, first things first; it all started roughly six months ago. I was on my monthly trip outside of my house, in a game store a few kilometers away. Visiting it was the only thing I looked forward to whenever I was basically dragged out of the house to do a test that I had no interest in, but I guess that’s the price As a preface, this is a story where my dad's friend told me this story and gave me permission to use it, and some of the story is a bit muddled. Also, the story is put into two parts, the first part is necessary to build up to the second part. amp#x200B; ED =Entitled Daughter EF =Entitled Father PF =Professor Friend AT =Assistant Teacher PFD =Professor Friend's Dad \ Sorry I had to use this but there are some weird labels\ amp#x200B; Here's the Story-. This happened back in mid-March, and I wrote it just after the incident took place, but I am massively derpy and managed to bork up posting it to JNMIL at the time and didn't realize it until now. On the positive side, I'm including the update here as well, so. yay? At any rate, please keep in mind while reading that this happened weeks ago, not actually "today". :D --------- Trigger Warning: It's BoyfriendA's Mother. Stupidity, violence, terrorizing of small children, and more stupidit. My local internet cafe is not much of a sight to behold. I think that’s what may have contributed to it shutting down for a couple months back in June. The exterior was reminiscent of an abandoned shack with its dilapidated appearance and broken windows. However, after they cleaned up the inside, I definitely saw some improvement. Sparkly clean tile floors and beautiful mahogany countertops filled the cafe with a sense of ease and elegance. I always got plenty of work done in there, so the shop’. ~~TW for ableism and related slur Previously on 2Mils: an introduction to Moneypit, Our Lady of Empty Pockets and Promises. It was such a good night, too. There I was, hanging in my comfy chair, debating whether to listen to Adventure Zone or check on my parsnips in Stardew Valley, when my phone started to go off. Now, there are three ringtones that immediately get my attention: 1. Hamster Dance. This is my default ringtone. Only God can judge me. 2. Call Me Maybe. DW's special ringtone.

Awe snap its almost time! . . . . Crap, that wasn't long enough it seems. Um. Shit, I can't think of anything to add to this to have it let me post. Why isn't this long enough? Should I have just commented on someone elses post? Is this all locked up. That stupid Post button is still grayed out. I guess I'll just tell my life's story. I was born many years ago to teenage parents. Like, super teen-aged, but it was cool they had been married for two years at that point. Original post here: Hey again, first off, I want to thank you all for the advice and care you guys have shown. It means a lot. Quite a bit has happened this past day. I stayed up so late last night, but I eventually just knocked out. I woke up this morning to Onyx moving in bed. She was fine. I asked her how she slept and she said that she woke up in the middle of the night because she thought. ##Kara Zor-El #23 - Two Minutes to Midnight (https://img00.deviantart.net/1eb4/i/2015/111/7/6/end_of_days_by_grandizer05-d6cfnk3.jpg) ^^ltlt ^^First (https://redd.it/4oa8zz) ^^ ^^lt ^^Previous (https://redd.it/84y95v) ^^ ^^Next ^^gt Author : Lexilogical (/r/DCFU/wiki/lexilogical) Book : Kara Zor-El (/r/DCFU/wiki/kara) Arc : Downfall (/r/DCFU/wiki/kara#wiki_.5Bprospects.5D) Event : Minutes to Midnight (/r/DCFU/wiki/events#wiki_minutes_to_mi. ^^^disregard ^^^username ## Hey there. Like a lot of you in this sub - I love movies. But lately I find myself watching them less and less. Like I want to, but. eh, I can do other things too. I've seen people do challenges like 365 movies a year. I don't think I can pull that off. But I decided to try and watch 1 movie every day in april. And if you're reading this - then I finished my own challenge! (yay) So here I'm sharing with you which films I saw and which ones I would recommend 1.1 - The BoJack Horseman Story: Chapter One Princess Carolyn: Does Tuesday work for you, or are you gonna be too busy this week masturbating to old pictures of yourself? BoJack: I told you, that's not what was happening that time! I was masturbating to what the picture represented  BoJack (weakly, lying on the ground): Todd. On my grave, I want it to say. that I was born in 1975. Todd (at the quinceanera, to BoJack): If you'll excuse me, I have a Virgin of Guadalupe pendant to present. 
I am writing this from inside my locked bathroom. I'm sorry if there are any grammatical errors but that doesn't matter, I can already feel it coming. This all started two days ago. My name is Dylan and I'm fifteen. I live in an apartment complex, with twenty or so other families and people. So I was walking I was walking home from school and I walked into the community lobby. Which is kind of like the big hub where people meet about important issues within the complex. So there I was, walking. We've finally reached the last entry in the Chakushin Ari series. We started with a classic from Takashi Miike. Followed swiftly by one of the biggest failures I've ever seen in a sequel with Chakushin Ari 2 and now we're here with Chakushin Ari 3 or Final. It was directed by Manabu Asô and stars Maki Horikita (Yogen / Premonition and The Locker). Let's get something out of the way. Is this better than Chakushin Ari 2? Well it's hard not to be considering how much that movie failed. Psyche, it went swimmingly. Early morning today, car is packed. Extra cigarettes, a couple of mix CDs with some feel-good music ( and some music I hadn't heard of before coming from you guys ( extra tissues (http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1vadf2/ive. ### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7jn1mb/roleplay_longhair_thats_bohemian_in_anglish_part_1/) Darkplace Sheriff’s Station Many hours later at the Darkplace Sheriff’s station, the boys were pulling a late shift in an effort to gleam any information that they could out of Jon the Parrot. The forensics team from Darkplace hospital, alongside a few miscellaneous deputies, were currently pouring over every detail of Hamish McDaid’s flat - up to and including Bastard! Max Hesher rolled over on his side to see if that was more comfortable. He could feel the springs beneath cutting into him through the thin futon mattress. He had never really noticed before he became a vampire how annoying that really was. But now that all his senses were that much more acute, every spring felt like a tiny dagger pressed against his back. It was bad enough on normal days. Trying to sleep on the daggers with a broken leg was sheer torture. Bastard bastard!. When I was a child, I used to think I had super powers. A little bit like a super hero, a little bit like a video game character. I wasn’t necessarily the brightest kid. One of my favorite childhood video games had a character who possessed the ability to double-jump. Jump once off of the ground, jump a second time midair to get even higher. I remember the first time I completed a double jump in the game, mind blown with this newfound knowledge, I immediately set down the controller and tried. Hope you all are enjoying the insanity that is #IDARB! There are a huge amount of creations being shared around in this subreddit, so this mega thread will gather all QR codes to help people find a specific character or a song.
